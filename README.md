This is a constantly moving game made with python turtle.

The concept of the game is to dodge the red circles and touch the green circles that come at the user, which is colored yellow in the game. The game gives the user three lives. Each time a red circle is touched the user will lose a life. Each time the user touches a green circle the game gives the him/her a point. The lives and points of the user are displayed at the bottom left of the game screen. Once the game ends, "GAME OVER" will be displayed in the middle of the screen

The game uses multiple objects for the user and different obstacles. It also contains different functions to make the code more concise. The whole program is brought together with a main() function that contains a function that brings together other various variables and functions to run the game.
